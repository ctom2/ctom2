# Hi, I'm [Tomáš Chobola](https://chobola.ai) 👋

I'm a final-year **PhD candidate** at *Helmholtz Munich & TU Munich*, specializing in efficient machine learning and computer vision for biomedical imaging.

My research focuses on building compute-efficient models (like **zero-shot** and **one-shot learning**) that perform in **data-scarce environments**. Additionally, I am currently developing **foundation models** for applications in the biomedical field. I have a proven record in the full research lifecycle, from initial concept to **first-author publication at A\* conferences** (ECCV, ICCV, AAAI, MICCAI) and to deployed, production-ready solutions.

## Pinned Projects

1. **CoLIE** (ECCV'24): One-shot model that outperforms fully-supervised methods in low-light image enhancement and achieves near real-time inference. There's [`🤗 demo`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chobola/colie) and [`Google Colab demo`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctom2/colie).
2. **Noise2Detail** (MICCAI'25): Ultra-lightweight 22k-parameter data-free denoising framework, 100-1000x smaller than typical denoising U-Nets, solving a key bottleneck for biomedical imaging where training data and compute are scarce. [`Google Colab demo`](https://github.com/ctom2/noise2detail)
3. **Privacy risks in Medical AI** (AISec'23): One of the first exhaustive studies of membership inference attacks on semantic segmentation models. The code quantitatively benchmarks the vulnerability of popular architectures and analyzes the trade-offs of various defenses.
